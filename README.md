# DTM_Project

A Data for Transportation Management project on the second semester of the Data Science Master's at UPC. 

The project consists of the creation of a basic pipeline to ingest, host, preprocess, and query transportation data coming from a fishing company that catches squid in the coasts of Argentina.

Performed mostly using Geopandas and Mobility DB. The visualizations in the ArcGIS visualizations folder were performed using ArcGIS.

Here's a small sample of what you can find in the repo!
